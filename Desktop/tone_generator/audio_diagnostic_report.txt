# JUCE Audio Effects Diagnostic Report

## Problem Summary
The tone generator app has a lush multi-oscillator synthesizer that generates audio correctly, but the auxiliary send/return effects (reverb and chorus) are not processing audio despite being properly configured.

## Current Architecture
- **Main Signal Path**: Dry signal goes directly to master output (preserved)
- **Effects Bus**: Copy of signal goes to reverb + chorus processing
- **Effects Return**: Processed effects get mixed back with dry signal (80% return)

## Debug Logs Analysis
```
MAIN AUDIO: After synth render - RMS: 0.0318482 (Active voices: 3) ✅
MAIN AUDIO: Effects buffer BEFORE processing - RMS: 0.0336561 ✅
MAIN AUDIO: Effects buffer AFTER reverb - RMS: 0 ❌
MAIN AUDIO: Effects buffer RMS: 0 ❌
MAIN AUDIO: After effects mixing - RMS: 0.0336561 ✅
MAIN AUDIO: FINAL OUTPUT - RMS: 0.0336561 ✅
```

## Key Findings
1. **Synth Audio Generation**: ✅ Working (RMS: 0.0318482)
2. **Audio Copy to Effects Buffer**: ✅ Working (RMS: 0.0336561)
3. **Reverb Processing**: ❌ FAILING (RMS drops to 0 after reverb.process())
4. **Chorus Processing**: ❌ FAILING (gets 0 input from reverb)
5. **Final Audio Output**: ✅ Working (dry signal preserved)

## Current Effect Parameters
### Reverb Settings:
- Room Size: 0.8 (large room for lush depth)
- Damping: 0.3 (low damping for lushness)
- Wet Level: 0.7 (70% wet on effects bus)
- Dry Level: 0.3 (30% dry on effects bus)
- Width: 1.0 (full stereo width)
- Freeze Mode: 0.0 (normal mode)

### Chorus Settings:
- Rate: 0.15 (slower rate for lush movement)
- Depth: 0.4 (deeper modulation for richness)
- Centre Delay: 0.012 (slightly longer delay for depth)
- Feedback: 0.1 (light feedback for warmth)
- Mix: 0.6 (60% wet on effects bus)

## Code Implementation
```cpp
// Create effects buffer and copy audio
juce::AudioBuffer<float> effectsBuffer(bufferToFill.buffer->getNumChannels(), bufferToFill.numSamples);
effectsBuffer.clear();

// Copy dry signal to effects buffer
for (int ch = 0; ch < bufferToFill.buffer->getNumChannels(); ++ch) {
    effectsBuffer.copyFrom(ch, 0, *bufferToFill.buffer, ch, bufferToFill.startSample, bufferToFill.numSamples);
}

// Process effects on the copy
juce::dsp::AudioBlock<float> effectsBlock(effectsBuffer);
juce::dsp::ProcessContextReplacing<float> effectsContext(effectsBlock);

// Process reverb on effects buffer
reverb.process(effectsContext);  // ← This is where audio gets silenced

// Process chorus on effects buffer
chorus.process(effectsContext);

// Mix effects back with dry signal (auxiliary return)
const float effectsReturn = 0.8f; // 80% return from effects
for (int ch = 0; ch < bufferToFill.buffer->getNumChannels(); ++ch) {
    for (int i = 0; i < bufferToFill.numSamples; ++i) {
        float drySample = bufferToFill.buffer->getSample(ch, bufferToFill.startSample + i);
        float wetSample = effectsBuffer.getSample(ch, i);
        float mixedSample = drySample + (wetSample * effectsReturn);
        bufferToFill.buffer->setSample(ch, bufferToFill.startSample + i, mixedSample);
    }
}
```

## Effect Initialization
```cpp
// Reverb setup
reverb.reset();
reverb.prepare(spec);
reverb.setParameters(reverbParams);

// Chorus setup
chorus.reset();
chorus.prepare(spec);
chorus.setRate(0.15f);
chorus.setDepth(0.4f);
chorus.setCentreDelay(0.012f);
chorus.setFeedback(0.1f);
chorus.setMix(0.6f);
```

## Technical Details
- **JUCE Version**: 8.0.10
- **Platform**: macOS (darwin 25.1.0)
- **Audio Format**: 2 channels, 256 samples per block
- **Sample Rate**: 44100 Hz
- **Effects**: juce::dsp::Reverb and juce::dsp::Chorus

## Suspected Issues
1. **Reverb Parameter Configuration**: The reverb might be configured incorrectly for auxiliary send/return
2. **Effect Processing Context**: The ProcessContextReplacing might not be working as expected
3. **Buffer Size Mismatch**: The effects might need different buffer preparation
4. **Effect State**: The effects might need to be reset/prepared differently for each buffer

## What Works
- Multi-oscillator synthesizer generates rich, lush audio
- Audio copying to effects buffer works correctly
- Dry signal preservation works perfectly
- Final audio output is audible

## What Doesn't Work
- Reverb completely silences the audio (RMS drops to 0)
- Chorus receives no input due to reverb failure
- No effects are audible in the final output

## Request for Help
The issue appears to be that `reverb.process(effectsContext)` is silencing the audio completely, despite the reverb parameters being set to 70% wet and 30% dry. The reverb should be processing the audio and adding lush spatial depth, but instead it's nulling the signal.

Any suggestions for fixing the reverb processing in this auxiliary send/return setup would be greatly appreciated.
